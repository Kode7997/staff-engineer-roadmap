Thread - for parallel computation. assign work to each of the thread
mutex - it is used for orderly access of resource or critical section
locks - used to lock specific section of code to achieve mutual exclusive.
async - Tasks based parallelism. chunks of works. async is an api to launch
        these tasks and make sure work is load-balanced. 

Policies of Async:
    1. std::launch::async -- creates new thread and executes when async is created
    2. std::launch::deferred -- execute when get() or wait() called and does NOT create New thread.
    3. async -- OS wil decide
